Remarks:
--------

- The program is a 2D solver for the incompressible, transient Navier-Stokes
  equations including the temperature equation and free boundary problems.
  It uses finite differences for discretization on a structured equidistant
  staggered grid, central and upwind (donor-cell) discretization of the 
  convective parts and an explicit time stepping scheme. The free 
  boundary value problems are treated with the MAC technique.

- The program was developed for education at a Computer Science Institute.
  Thus, it is easy to understand and easy to implement but it is not a
  "state of the art" program. 

- The program is written in C.

- Compilation of the program with "make".

- Uses C-compiler is "gcc" (see "makefile")

- Run the program by
	"run <Inputfile>"    e.g."run dcavity.par".

- In the inputfiles "*.par" (examples can be found in the sub-directory
  "examples"), the parameters for the program are given, such as
  the parameters for the discretization, for the fluid, for the
  initial data,... The inputfile given when starting "run" is read
  at the beginning of the program.

- The following problems are implemented and inputfiles are available
  in the subdirectory "examples"
  * dcavity:		Driven Cavity
  * backstep:		Flow over a backward facing step
  * balken:		Flow past an inclined plate
  * kreis:		Flow past a circular obstacle
  * klappen:            Flow through a T-junction
  * damm:               Breaking dam (free boundary value problem FBVP)
  * tropfen:            Splash of a liquid drop (FBVP)
  * spritzguss:         Injection moulding (FBVP)
  * wafa:               Flow over a backward facing step with free surface
  * convection:         Buoyancy flow with heated side walls
  * fluidtrap:          Buoyancy flow with obstacles
  * rayleigh:           Buoyancy flow with heated upper and lower wall
			(Rayleigh-Benard Flow)

- For some problems (e.g. backstep, balken, kreis) the pressure correction
  does not converge in the first time steps. This is due to the fact that 
  the initial velocity field does not satisfy the continuity equation.

- It is possible to store intermediate data in "outfile" specified in the 
  inputfile. Later on, you can use this intermediate data as initial data
  for continuing your simulation if you specify this file as input-data 
  "infile".

- The comments in the code are not very detailed. For a complete
  description of the code, please see the book.

- For the implementation of new problems, it is necessary to write
  a new inputfile, to modify the boundary data in the function
  "SETSPECBCOND" in the file "boundary.c" and the definition of the
  obstacles in "INIT_FLAG" ("init.c").

- Parallelization and turbulence simulation described in the book are
  not included in this package.

- For visualization, there are two matlab scripts available (showData.m and showParticles.m)
  in the sub-directory "examples/matlab/". 
  Using other visualization software, it might be necessary to adapt the functions
  "OUTPUTVEC_bin" and "WRITE_PARTICLES_bin" in visual.c.

ATTENTION: The program was developed on a HP workstation. 
           There might appear some problems under DOS or WINDOWS95
